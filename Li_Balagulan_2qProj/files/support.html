		<h2>Why did I choose this advocacy?</h2>
		<p class="par1">Our environment has helped humanity thrive throughout the years. From the stone age to the modern world, it has vastly increased our knowledge and has paved the way for our world's development. But now, some species that are living in it are struggling to maintain their population. When this happens, it is a sign that our ecosystem is slowly falling apart. </p>
		<p class="par1">We, humans, depend on our ecosystem for our survival. Therefore, we should make sure to preserve and protect it for our sake. Without it, humans would be struggling to survive. Conserving the environment and ecosystem and making sure it's healthy would most likely result in a good health for the organisms living in it.</p>

		<h2>A Call to Action</h2>
		<p class="par2"><img id="p4" src="../images/pe2.jpg" alt="Philippine Eagle">Spreading awareness about the existence and current situation of endangered species is a big step towards saving these organisms from being extinct. The first step to protecting endangered species is to learn about their habitat and see their importance and role in this world we live in. Make sure to avoid using single-use plastics to reduce pollution and habitat destruction.</p>
		<p class="par2">Reduce, reuse, and recycle! A zero-waste lifestyle is almost impossible so this would be the best alternative. Implementing this system will greatly reduce pollution in our environment. Furthermore, planting more trees and supporting other environment-related advocacies in your area are considered important activities in saving our environment. You may also help by donating to our organization. Your donation will be used for many environment-saving initiatives like tree-planting, coastal cleanup, waste management education to communities, and many others.</p>
